### My History

Born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh. After Bachelors in  engineering and Masters in business,  and working for 10 years as telecommunications network analyst, mobile broadband network planner and strategic planner, I found myself attracted to everything data. Now, I'm here trying to delve deeper into the world of data and upskill myself in data exploration, analysis and most importantly data-driven decision making.
