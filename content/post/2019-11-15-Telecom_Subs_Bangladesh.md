This is the third entry in my series of Visualizing Bangladesh. This time an animated chart of mobile telecom subscriber trend with key events from 2001 onwards.

Mobile telephony in Bangladesh actually started in 1989 but due to subscriber data unavailability, I have to start from 2001. If any kind soul has the data of yester years and willing to share,  do give me a knock.
