This is the fifth entry in my series of Visualizing Bangladesh. This time an animated chart of labor participation rate by male and female over the years for people aged 15-64 years . Female participation rate vastly improved (+11 pp in just last decade) and the gap is closing in fast. But of course, still a long way to go.

Interestingly, male participation rate is declining (>4pp in last decade). Are we becoming lazy?
