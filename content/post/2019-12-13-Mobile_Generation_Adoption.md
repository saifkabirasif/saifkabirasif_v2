As the World slowly ventures into 5G era, I think this is a good time to trace the trail of wireless cellular technology adoption by countries over the years. Hence, this visualization charting the adoption of 3G,4G and 5G.

Few Notes:

* By 3G, I picked only 3GPP standard of WCDMA. So, you may see China missing 3G up till 2009 as they were using TD-SCDMA, CDMA2000 etc. until China Unicorn launched WCDMA
* Bangladesh 4G adoption is shown as 2015 as Ollo claimed to launch LTE that year in some sites. But mass adoption occurred in 2018 February when Grameenphone, Robi Axiata and Banglalink launched LTE.
* Field trials or proof of concepts are excluded.
