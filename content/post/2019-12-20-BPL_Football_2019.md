Though a bit late to the party, finally done with a racing bar chart with Bangladesh Premier League Football 2019 points table.

Steps taken:

* Scraped match data from web 
* Lots of cleansing and munging specially to interpolate a smooth transition between numbers
* Animation (easy part)
* Animation compression to save loading time (most time consuming)

Tools used:

- Mostly R with image optimization done with several node.js packages
