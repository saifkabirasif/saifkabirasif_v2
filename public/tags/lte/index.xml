<p>This is the first visualization of year 2020 where I intend to be more active in my blog. The visualization is about mobile subscription trend over the years. Although 4G/LTE is yet to peak, we expect to see huge adoption of 5G within 2-3 years as forecasted by Ericsson.</p>
<p>The major advantages of 5G over 4G will be-</p>
<ul>
<li>Better speed (Obvious! Else how are we gonna stream those 4K/8K VR videos )</li>
<li>Lower latency (The solution for a better Google Stadia and maybe lesser cables)</li>
<li>Lots of devices under same area (Home is truly gonna be sci-fi. Imagine hundreds of sensors to help (and track) you all day long)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools used:</p>

<p>As the World slowly ventures into 5G era, I think this is a good time to trace the trail of wireless cellular technology adoption by countries over the years. Hence, this visualization charting the adoption of 3G,4G and 5G.</p>
<p>Few Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>As some of my peers was misinterpreting the visualization due to exclusion of CDMA stream in 3G, I decided to re-do the visualization including CDMA stream.</li>
<li>Bangladesh 4G adoption is shown as 2015 as Ollo claimed to launch LTE that year in some sites. But mass adoption occurred in 2018 February when Grameenphone, Robi Axiata and Banglalink launched LTE.</li>
<li>Field trials or proof of concepts are excluded. Only commercial launch announcements (even with very minuscule coverage) is included</li>
</ul>

<p>As the World slowly ventures into 5G era, I think this is a good time to trace the trail of wireless cellular technology adoption by countries over the years. Hence, this visualization charting the adoption of 3G,4G and 5G.</p>
<p>Few Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>By 3G, I picked only 3GPP standard of WCDMA. So, you may see China missing 3G up till 2009 as they were using TD-SCDMA, CDMA2000 etc. until China Unicorn launched WCDMA</li>
<li>Bangladesh 4G adoption is shown as 2015 as Ollo claimed to launch LTE that year in some sites. But mass adoption occurred in 2018 February when Grameenphone, Robi Axiata and Banglalink launched LTE.</li>
<li>Field trials or proof of concepts are excluded.</li>

<p>4G has been launched in Bangladesh on 19-Feb'2018 by four operators - Grameenphone, Robi, Banglalink and state-owned Teletalk . Though everyone is raving about higher speed(throughput), 4G is not about brute speed only. It is also about user experience.</p>
<p>So, lets check how the experience fares. The test has been performed at 6:30 PM at the busy business district of Gulshan while moving through a car.</p>
